The model predicts solar power with the help of regression techniques and mean square error parameters
Solar energy is one of the most abundant sustainable and green energy sources on the planet. Several scientific studies on solar energy to get optimum solar radiation during the day and to measure solar power output are getting popular. In recent years, the rate of installing solar panels has exponentially increased because of its sustainable power-producing capabilities.
